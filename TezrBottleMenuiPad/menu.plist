						<string>Vintage Sparkling Wine from Champagne, France

Since 1843, six generations of the Krug Family have been creating the finest and rarest Champagnes. Behind every precious drop of Krug stands the dream of a visionary. One man who, long before others, understood that the essence of Champagne is pleasure. So, over 170 years ago, Joseph Krug broke with convention to follow his vision: to create the most generous expression of Champagne every year, regardless of climatic unpredictability. Thanks to an uncompromising craftsmanship, a unique individual plot by plot approach from harvesting to blending, an unparalleled library of 150 reserve wines, and an exceptional cellar aging, Krug is the benchmark when it comes to the best champagnes in the world.

Krug Grande Cuvée is the flagship of the House and the archetype of Krug’s philosophy of craftsmanship and savoir-faire: a blend of more than 120 wines from ten or more different years. Its exceptional finesse is the result of a stay of at least another six years in the cellars. Over twenty years are needed to craft each bottle of Krug Grande Cuvee.

Every year since the foundation of the House in 1843, one creation, one blend, one bottling and thus one new Edition of Krug Grande Cuvée has come to life. The number of the Edition is now featured on the front label, and this year we celebrate the 164th Edition.

At first sight, the beautiful light golden color promises radiant freshness. The nose begins with an expressive bouquet of ginger, candied citrus and quince, followed by richer notes evoking lemon meringue tart, plum and mirabelle. On the palate, a very balanced Champagne with light notes of brioche and honey giving way to an array of fresh citrus, including oranges, lemons and mandarins, enhanced by a very elegant finish.

Krug 2004 is a dialogue between shining Chardonnays (39%) and the backbone of Pinot Noir (37%) combined with the vivacity, tension and citrus notes of Meunier (24%).The elegance of Krug 2004 comes after over 12 years in the cellars gaining in harmony, expression and finesse. Krug 2004 is the last of the second trilogy in the history of the House, the first being 1988, 1989 and 1990 and the second 2002, 2003 and 2004.

						<string>Rosé Sparkling Wine from Champagne, France

Krug Rosé is a relatively recent addition to the Krug range of Champagnes, having been introduced first in 1983. While produced in a manner similar to other Krug Champagnes and stylistically consistent, it nevertheless presents a uniquely exotic and intriguing set of aromas and flavors. It&apos;s color is a pale salmon, suggesting the barest hint of pink. It is quite dry and appealing with a wide array of cuisines. Krug Rosé is a unique blend that spans four to six different vintages, three grape varieties, and encompasses all the complexities of the Krug style. It is aged for a minimum of six years before release. Krug Rosé is produced only occasionally and in strictly limited quantities.


Since 1843, six generations of the Krug Family have been creating the finest and rarest Champagnes. Behind every precious drop of Krug stands the dream of a visionary. One man who, long before others, understood that the essence of Champagne is pleasure. So, over 170 years ago, Joseph Krug broke with convention to follow his vision: to create the most generous expression of Champagne every year, regardless of climatic unpredictability. Thanks to an uncompromising craftsmanship, a unique individual plot by plot approach from harvesting to blending, an unparalleled library of 150 reserve wines, and an exceptional cellar aging, Krug is the benchmark when it comes to the best champagnes in the world.

Krug Grande Cuvée is the flagship of the House and the archetype of Krug’s philosophy of craftsmanship and savoir-faire: a blend of more than 120 wines from ten or more different years. Its exceptional finesse is the result of a stay of at least another six years in the cellars. Over twenty years are needed to craft each bottle of Krug Grande Cuvee.

Every year since the foundation of the House in 1843, one creation, one blend, one bottling and thus one new Edition of Krug Grande Cuvée has come to life. The number of the Edition is now featured on the front label, and this year we celebrate the 164th Edition.</string>

						<string>In 1876, Tsar Alexander II - already a great lover of Louis Roederer wines - asked Louis Roederer to &quot;take the exercise still further&quot; and create a cuvée for his personal use which was unique, in terms of both its style and the bottle. So Louis Roederer offered him an exceptional crystal bottle, holding the fruit of vines selected from the seven great crus on his estate. The Chardonnay and Pinot Noir grapes provide the subtle, precise balance that has now become synonymous with the leading prestige cuvée of Champagne.
A yellow-gold color with mat and amber tints. Persistent, brilliant, fine and lively bubbles. A subtle bouquet, simultaneously discreet and concentrated. It releases notes of citrus compote and candied apricots and evokes the sweetness of honeysuckle. When aerated, notes of vanilla-edged cocoa bean emerge, with toasted hazelnut, hints of liquorice and even a touch of cinnamon. The palate is structured, energetic and sculpted. An initial dense, ripe and silky sensation is amplified by the discovery of a chalky, cherry freshness, a powdered, almost mentholated brightness. The feeling is delicate and ethereal, a succession of delicious and colorful textures perfectly integrated within the lightness and finesse of the wine... an invitation on a journey of discovery. The bright personality of Cristal then appears, simultaneously pure and sharp, in a finish focused once again on chalk, energy and grain.

Champagne Louis Roederer was founded in 1776 in Reims, France and is one of the rare family owned companies, which is still managed by the Roederer family. In 1833, Louis Roederer inherited the company from his uncle and renamed the company under his namesake. Under his leadership, the company rapidly grew while remaining true to their philosophy of uncompromising quality. Today, the company is under the helm of Jean-Claude Rouzaud and his son Frédéric who continue to place quality before quantity.
First-Rate Vineyards
Champagne Louis Roederer is one of the only French champagne producers to own nearly 75 percent of the grapes in the most desirable vineyards in the Champagne. The property is located on 450 acres in the finest villages of Montagne de Reims, Côtes des Blancs, and Valleé de la Marne. Each region is selected to produce Chardonnay and Pinot Noir with the elegance needed for perfectly balanced champagne. The Louis Roederer vineyards rate an average 98 percent based on France’s statutory 100-point classification scale.
The reserve wine is then tasted and graded by a team of Roederer specialists. They choose as many as 40 different wines from several lots for the blend.

It has a light pink hue with green and brown highlights.There is a regular and persistent stream of extremely delicate and dynamic bubbles.A fresh bouquet that is both intense and refined. The initial description is ‘salty’: a blend of petals and dried flowers delicately spiced (white pepper) by the beginnings of oxidation and zests of bloody orange. There is a sensation of the fullness and vivacity of a fine end to the summer, profiting from the warmth of the last rays of sunshine—such concentration and energy! The lightly toasted almond notes strengthen this sensation of sweetness.The mouth is an intense and concentrated blend of fruit. The attack is ‘high’ in energy: the full force of the great concentrated wine comes to the fore! Orange zest, with juicy and unctuous fruit, complements this impression of concentrated fruitiness. The tannins, with their sappiness, delineate the precise and pure contours of the wine’s solid structure. Finally, the long and persistent freshness, enhanced by the right dosage, provides a long finish and reveals almost Bourguignon grainy tannins.

Blend: 56% Pinot Noir and 44% Chardonnay.

The 2008 edition of the prestige cuvee Belle Epoque reveals aromas of flowers and white-fleshed fruit enveloped in candied citrus notes that give it an expansive mouthfeel.
This Perrier-Jouet Belle Epoque set includes one 750ml 2008 Vintage and 2 historical Belle Époque flutes.

Perrier-Jouët was founded in 1811 in Epernay by Pierre-Nicolas-Marie Perrier and his wife, Adele Jouët. One of the most prestigious houses in Champagne, the firm was shipping wine to Great Britain by 1813 and to the United States by 1837. Perrier-Jouët owns 266 acres of vineyards in Champagne, with an average rating of 95%, and is known worldwide for its consistency of style.

By the end of the 19th Century, its Brut cuvées earned the reputation of nobility and prestige that continues today. Perrier Jouët&apos;s glamorous &quot;Cuvée Belle Epoque&quot;, known in the United States as Fleur de Champagne, was launched in 1969 and has become the most important cuvée de prestige to appear after World War II. The bottle is adorned with enamel-painted anenomes originally created by Emile Gallé in 1900, but the wine is as famous for its taste as it is for its beautiful packaging.</string>

It is a rare treat, making it quite a pricey Champagne. But in Vintage years, you will get 100% Chardonnay from the Côte des Blancs—specifically from the village of Cramant. Among the best, there is no doubt that you will experience a sublime wine when you pop this one open.

Perrier-Jouët was founded in 1811 in Epernay by Pierre-Nicolas-Marie Perrier and his wife, Adele Jouët. One of the most prestigious houses in Champagne, the firm was shipping wine to Great Britain by 1813 and to the United States by 1837. Perrier-Jouët owns 266 acres of vineyards in Champagne, with an average rating of 95%, and is known worldwide for its consistency of style.

By the end of the 19th Century, its Brut cuvées earned the reputation of nobility and prestige that continues today. Perrier Jouët&apos;s glamorous &quot;Cuvée Belle Epoque&quot;, known in the United States as Fleur de Champagne, was launched in 1969 and has become the most important cuvée de prestige to appear after World War II. The bottle is adorned with enamel-painted anenomes originally created by Emile Gallé in 1900, but the wine is as famous for its taste as it is for its beautiful packaging.</string>

						<string>Non-Vintage Sparkling Wine from Champagne, France

Veuve Clicquot&apos;s Brut Yellow Label reflects the superb vineyards they own and the consistent nature of their House style.

The predominance of Pinot Noir provides the structure that is so typically Clicquot, while a touch of Pinot Meunier rounds out the blend. Chardonnay adds the elegance and finesse essential in a perfectly balanced wine.

When he founded his wine merchant business under the label &quot;Clicquot&quot; in 1772, Philippe Clicquot had a clear ambition: cross all borders. He conquered Europe and then Russia in 1780, followed by the United States in 1782. He was joined at the head of the House in 1798 by his son, François Clicquot, who had recently married Barbe Ponsardin. Seven years later, following the untimely death of François Clicquot, his young widow (&quot;veuve&quot; in French), just 27 years old, took over the family business.

Over the course of her lifetime, Madame Clicquot developed three of the most important innovations in Champagne, that remain in practice today. She demonstrated her innovative spirit in 1810 by producing the first vintage wine in Champagne. In 1816, she invented the riddling table as a way to clarify her champagne, and by doing so, she improved both the quality and finesse of the wines. Never one to rest on her laurels, in 1818 Madame Clicquot created the first rose champagne made through assemblage, a method where white wines are blended with red wines.

Faithful to the values of creativity and innovation passed on by Madame Clicquot, the Maison marked its bottles with its first yellow label in 1877, making the brand distinctive and instantly recognizable. Today, Veuve Clicquot Yellow Label is the signature champagne of the House, and distinguishes itself through the dominance of Pinot Noir, which gives strength, complexity and elegance to the champagne.</string>

This non-vintage Rose is the end result of a desire to create a Rose champagne with a delightfully luscious, fruit-based charm. Jacques Peters, the cellarmaster, and his team wanted a champagne that would be accessible and naturally engaging while conserving Veuve Clicquot&apos;s essential values in terms of style.

The wine has a luminous color with attractive pink glints. The nose is generous and elegant, with initial aromas of fresh red fruit (raspberry, wild strawberry, cherry, blackberry), leading to biscuity notes of dried fruits and Viennese pastries (almonds, apricots and brioche).

The fresh attack is followed by a fruity harmonious sensation on the palate. The wine is perfectly balanced in the best Veuve Clicquot style of pink champagnes, combining elegance and flair. The wine works its magic—this delectably full champagne can be enjoyed as a true delicacy. A deliciously fruity wine in earlybloom, this is a wonderful aperitif to be shared as a twosome or simply with friends.
Made using 50 to 60 different crus, the cuvee is based on Brut Yellow Label&apos;s traditional blend: 50 to 55% Pinot Noir, 15 to 20% Pinot Meunier, and 28 to 33% Chardonnay.

La Grande Dame 2006 is an exclusive blend of Pinot Noir and Chardonnay from eight classic Grands Crus. In line with the style of the house, which is Pinot Noir dominant, the blend is 53% Pinot Noir and 47% Chardonnay. The wine has intense color with golden glints and very fine sparkling bubbles. Each cuvée of La Grande Dame has exceptional aging potential. The current vintage 2006 can be enjoyed now until 2025.

						<string>The 2015 ZD Cabernet Sauvignon, with its beautiful dark ruby color and intense aromas of black cherry, cassis and spicy red plum, is another example of an exceptional year from the Napa Valley. This vintage will be remembered for much lighter than anticipated yields across all varietals. An unseasonably cool period in May, in the middle of bloom, resulted in light fruit set and fewer grape clusters. However, lower yields provided great depth of flavor and concentration.

Following ZD’s signature style of producing big, ripe, powerful yet balanced Cabernet Sauvignons, the fruit was sourced from several small, intensely farmed Napa Valley vineyards. These lots were fermented separately and punched down three times a day to ensure an effective, but gentle, extraction of color and tannins. After one year in American Oak barrels, the vineyard lots were blended and barrel aged for an additional year before bottling.

The core of ripe, dark fruit integrates seamlessly with subtle hints of vanilla, spice and toast while the lush, silky tannins round out the incredibly long finish. Dark and dense, and bursting with complexity, this wine will continue to age gracefully for many years to come. 176 barrels were produced. Enjoy!</string>

						<string>From the Label

Our Napa Valley Chardonnay comes primarily from grapes grown in the cool-climate Carneros district at the southern tip of the valley. Subject to fog and cooling breezes from nearby San Pablo Bay, Carneros enjoys a long growing season that ripens its fruit fully while retaining the bright acidity that gives Cakebread Cellars Chardonnay its freshness and vitality. We complement our Carneros fruit with grapes from warmer sites in the valley that yield riper, fuller chardonnays. This allows us to craft a rich, yet elegant and complex chardonnay that drinks beautifully on release, but ages gracefully in the bottle.</string>

Pop open a bottle of Ciroc Peach Vodka, and you&apos;re immediately greeted with the aroma of sun-ripened fresh peaches. It&apos;s excellent chilled as a shot or in a rocks glass with a few ice cubes. However, the true brilliance of Ciroc Peach comes out when it&apos;s blended in a cocktail. When you&apos;re feeling classy or you want to spice up your next brunch with guests, add a splash of champagne for the ultimate Peach Bellini. If the weather&apos;s nice and you want to feel the cool ocean breeze without leaving your house, go with a Peach on the Beach. Mix cranberry juice, orange juice and Ciroc with a slice of lime to get a little taste of the Caribbean. 

Unlike most vodkas, which are made from grain, CÎROC Ultra-Premium Vodka is distilled from fine French grapes, a process inspired by over a century of wine-making expertise and craftsmanship.

						<string>Vodka lovers, you&apos;ve never sipped an ultra-premium spirit like this before. Cîroc is a French vodka distilled from grapes harvested from the Gaillac and Cognac regions. After an innovative cold fermentation process, Cîroc is distilled five times to produce an amazingly smooth vodka. One of the most distinct vodkas on the market, Cîroc is sure to stick with you.

Cîroc may be distilled from grapes, but when you sip this vodka, you&apos;ll taste some lightly fruity notes rather than a full-on grape flavor. Look for notes of orange and anise and enjoy the crisp finish of this luxurious spirit.

Sure, you can sip Cîroc. But why not mix it in a celebrity-inspired cocktail? Try The Diddy, which includes equal parts Cîroc and lemonade, or the Lola, which boasts pomegranate juice and a splash of bubbly. No matter how you enjoy it, this is a vodka that&apos;s ideal for celebrations</string>

						<string>If you&apos;re looking for a delicious, authentic tequila, check out Casamigos Reposado. This tequila is aged for seven months before being let out into the world. The flavor offers just a little hint of cocoa and caramel, with an oaky taste due to the white oak barrels it is stored in. The smell of this tequila will remind you of vanilla, maple, spices and peanut shells. Casamigos Reposado offers a sweet flavor, making it a great option for drinking by itself or mixing in your favorite cocktails.

Casamigos Reposado starts off with blue agave plants in the Jalisco Highlands. Each plant is hand-selected to give you the best flavor selected. From there, the agave plant is slow-cooked, allowing it to ferment. As the tequila rests and ages in old whiskey barrels it takes on its unique and interesting oaky flavor.

Because of the unique and bold flavor of Casamigos Reposado, it&apos;s a great tequila to sip. You can drink this neat or on the rocks, giving you something to savor and enjoy. However, it also works great as a mixing drink in a variety of cocktails.

Try a Sweet Amigos if you&apos;re looking for a new cocktail to add to your favorites. This drink features two ounces of Casamigos Reposado and a quarter ounce of agave nectar or simple syrup. Muddle a half of an orange wheel and a pitted dark sweet cherry together and add to the drink. Drop in a pinch of cinnamon, mix all together and strain into a cup.</string>

During that time it ferments into a brilliant mix of sweet agave, citrus and vanilla. You&apos;re bound to taste the aftermath of the process as soon as it hits your lips.

Enjoying a great tequila is a lot like watching your favorite sporting event. You aren&apos;t sure what happens next but you&apos;re hoping for an exciting finish. Thankfully, Casamigos Blanco embodies that idea in a single drink. The best way to enjoy this agave-distilled liquor is through a chilled shot. Only then can you take in all the fine aromas and tastes.

If you aren&apos;t one for straight-up liquor, Casamigos Blanco lends itself well when mixed into almost any type of tequila-based drink. A Tequila Sunrise might act as an eye-opener or carry you through a late night fiesta. Mix it with tequila, orange juice and a dash of grenadine for a refreshing mix of Mexico in a glass.

Another option for Casamigos Blanco is in the classic margarita. Mixed with lime juice, triple sec and Casamigos Blanco, there&apos;s no better way to relax out on the beach or unwind after a tough day at the office. This tequila soothes what ails you. If you don&apos;t like it, take it up with Clooney.</string>

						<key>notes</key>
						<string>Bacardi Superior is Bacardi&apos;s flagship rum and the one that started it all way back in 1862. In this year, founder Don Facundo Bacardi purchased the land in Cuba that would become the distillery that changed the way the world drank rum. By pioneering charcoal filtration and purposeful aging, Bacardi created Bacardi white rum, which set the standard for flavor and balance. However, it wasn&apos;t without hardship. The Cuban Revolution forced Bacardi from Cuba, and today, the Cathedral of Rum is in Puerto Rico. It still imparts all the distillation processes that make it the world&apos;s top-selling rum brand, and the stuff that every rapper and pop icon seems to consider the ultimate party accompaniment.

With its unique balance and light taste, Bacardi Superior pairs beautifully with mint and lime without being overly dominant in the cocktail. This means that it&apos;s perfect for a mojito or a Cuba Libre, but without the overwhelming taste of alcohol. The reason for this wonderful marriage lies in the undertones of the rum, which imparts flavors such as citrus, coriander and ginger. Each batch of Bacardi White Rum gets these flavors thanks to the highest-quality ingredients, including sugar cane and yeasts that are only found in the Caribbean. Thanks to these ingredients, the flavor profile evokes visions of white sand beaches, palm trees and crystal-clear ocean waters. Even if you can only fill a kiddie pool to sit in, Bacardi Superior Rum takes you away from it all.</string>

						<key>notes</key>
						<string>Naturally aged at least four and a half years in the cellars of France&apos;s Château de Cognac, D’USSÉ™ VSOP Cognac emerges as a bold, full-bodied blend that arouses the palate. On the nose, it reveals a powerful bouquet, rich in woody notes that are layered with touches of cinnamon and floral notes. Distinctively and unexpectedly smooth, with each taste, you savor hints of spices, almond and cinnamon. Subtle accents of honey and dried fruits are the finale.

D&apos;usse VSOP Cognac is a new product from an old house. For over 200 years, master distillers have blended eau de vie at the Chateaur de Cognac on the Charente River.

This property is unique because of its two distinct cellars. One cellar maintains a constant 59 degrees and 90 percent humidity. The other is further from the water and drier. The humid cellar brings out the floral and airy nature of the spirit. The dry cellar draws out woody, spicy flavors.

After spending four and a half years between the two cellars, the result is complex and medium-bodied cognac. D&apos;usse VSOP Cognac is not an overpowering giant, but it is not gentle and delicate, either.

The color is a rich, coppery amber. Waft a snifter of it under your nose. You&apos;ll detect fresh cut wood, blossoms, apricot and caramel. Take a sip and you&apos;ll taste almonds, honey, dried apricots and a touch of cinnamon. The finish is long and constantly developing, with the staying power of a great XO.

Certainly, it needs nothing more than a glass, but if you&apos;re feeling exotic, try The Code. Shake an ounce and a half of D&apos;usse with an ounce of amaretto, another of pineapple juice and a dash of bitters. Strain it over the rocks with a lime wedge.</string>

Serve neat in a tumbler with a glass of iced water on the side to fully appreciate the slow, intense, rich, deep and multilayered experience. Blue Label is the ultimate tribute to those who define themselves not by where they stand, but by where they are going. It has traditionally been enjoyed on holidays, birthdays, and moments of celebration and achievement; regardless of the occasion, it is a gift for those whose defining moment has yet to be defined.

						<string>Proudly touted as &quot;a most unusual gin,&quot; Hendrick&apos;s Gin is a delightfully curious liquid with a unique character that stands out from the rest. This small-batch gin is produced by William Grant &amp; Sons and infused with cucumber, rose and traditional juniper at the brand&apos;s Scottish distillery. Small batches are typically defined as 1,000 liters or fewer, but Hendrick&apos;s Gin is crafted in tiny 500-liter batches, giving the master distiller more control over her artistry.

Hendrick&apos;s is the result of combining two different spirits from rare and unusual stills: the Bennet still and the Carter-Head still. The exceptionally smooth gin features a nice balance of subtle flavors, which include wonderful notes of flowers, fruits, roots and seeds from across the world. In fact, the Wall Street Journal has described Hendrick&apos;s as the &quot;Best Gin in the World.&quot;

William Grant &amp; Sons suggests serving the gin over ice with tonic water. Garnish with a cucumber slice instead of the traditional lemon wedge. Another great option is to serve the gin with soda water and a bit of elderflower.

You can also create an odd variety of cocktails with distinctive bouquets. Gordon&apos;s Cup is a sour-and-salty concoction that marries cucumber, salt and pepper, lime juice and freshly ground salt and pepper. If that&apos;s too ambitious, try a simple Gin &amp; Tonic using Hendrick&apos;s.</string>
